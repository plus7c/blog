0. 花更少的时间，做更多的事情。目标要转变，应该把目标放在如何用更少的时间**完成更多重要的事情，而不是长时间工作**。

    - Your progress should be measured by impact not the effort .When I was a student the top performer in the classroom was not the one who studies the most hours on the daily basis This might sound contradictory but being busy is often used as a guise to avoid doing the most critical or uncomfortable thing 

1. 结果不由数量和时间决定，而是**由做什么决定**。衡量做什么的方法可以用坐标轴表示，x轴表示紧迫性，y轴表示重要性。给工作排序时，问问自己如果今天只能做这件事情，我会感到高兴吗。优先考虑重要的事情，并花尽量少的精力去做。

    - What is ruthless prioritization. To quote Sheryl Sandberg is to "work on the best idea among the good ones" Doing something that has value isn't enough ,you want work on things that has the most value has the biggest outcome can provide you the most impact

2. 在**必要时**习惯多线程处理任务，这样能减少我们在琐碎事情上花费过多的时间，但要注意**只在必要的时候这样做**。因为频繁切换工作上下文也会耗费精力。

    - obviously you don't want to actively seek multitasking opportunities but at times when you have to switch onto something so that you can be unblocked multitasking might save your day 

3. **找到自己的强项**，和高考思维不一样，高考在弱项上花时间会有相对较高的回报，但在职场上，真正有价值的是我们自身的长处。

    - Think about it a barista is hired because they make good coffee,a carpenter is hired because they make good furniture If they do their job well I literally don't care if they suck at cooking You are hired because of what you're good at because of what differentiates you from other people which is your strength

4. 即时不在电脑前，也要花时间**思考问题**，这样当开始工作的时候，就能有可执行的计划。

    - Whether if it's a solution to a coding problem or an overall architecture of a system you're building or if you're working on writing something a lot of these ideas are probably not generated when you are sitting in front of a computer You need to spend more time thinking 07:00 so that every time you actually arrive at the office or start working you're gonna have an actual executable plan 

5. 知道在什么时候该**停下来**，我们工作的最终目的是为了更好地生活，找到自己想要的生活方式。但不要把这句话当成偷懒的借口，而是避免陷入工作至上的思维。

    - "Working at Facebook is a marathon not a sprit". And I found myself repeatedly telling people this ever since I would also argue that not just in tech companies but in every business there's always gonna be infinite amount of work to do .That's just the nature of it .

6. 找到**自我认同感**，职业介绍不是个人介绍
    - For a lot of people including me we feel happy and proud of our work The work I'm doing or the job I have makes a large part of my identity but ultimately I would also constantly tell myself that your job doesn't define you Your job description isn't your self description We all need to find something bigger and that's often times outside of our primary job
